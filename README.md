A Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://cs.jhu.edu), I am interested in the
future of AI- and robot-assisted interventional healthcare. My [recent
work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=QX7AvxUAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
advances physics- and learning-based simulations -- from single image formation to room-scale
environments -- as the basis for intelligent assistance systems and immersive educational
experiences. I am a member of the Advanced Robotics and Computationally Augmented Environments
([ARCADE](https://arcade.cs.jhu.edu/)) research group, led by [Mathias
Unberath](https://mathiasunberath.github.io), and the Computation Interaction and Robotics
Laboratory ([CIRL](https://cirl.lcsr.jhu.edu/)) led by [Greg Hager](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/hager/).
In 2023, I received the [Link Foundation Fellowship in Modeling, Simulation, and
Training](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news/link-foundation-fellowship/), which supports my work preparing
clinicians for the future operating room using interactive digital twins. In 2019, I earned a B.A.
in Computer Science with Honors from the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu), with a minor
in Physics. Outside of academia, I have interned with [IBM Research -
Almaden](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/), [Epic Systems](https://www.epic.com), and
[Intuitive Surgical](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us).
